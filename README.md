## Projects
### [Cement Damage Detection]()
**Areas**: Computer Vision, Python Programming, Machine Learning, Binary Classification

This project used deep learning algorithms and transfer learning to classify cement images based on whether a crack is detected. Three different sub-projects were created based on different Python libraries. Each library produced a model with at least 99% accuracy on the test data. This project can be adapted for engineering applications such as equipment fault detection and structural integrity analysis.

### [Road Sign Detection]()
**Areas**: Computer Vision, Python Programming, Machine Learning, Multi-class Classification

This project used deep learning algorithms and transfer learning to classify various road sign images. This was done using the Keras Python library with at least 88% accuracy on the test data. This project can be adapted for various applications, notably computer vision for self-driving cars.
